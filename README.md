# Springboot-hibernate-spring-security-example

This example shows how spring's framework can reduce boiler plate code and the overall complexity of developing a system where access to 
various view resources are governed via spring security's ant matchers and security tags library. This Example also highlights the simplicity of 
combining spring and hibernate when mapping objects to and from a database. The theme set in this example  consists of an online hotel booking system 
for an individual hotel chain who's system is shared by both regular users and the hotel's administration staff
